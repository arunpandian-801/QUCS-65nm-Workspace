# About
This repository hosts all the schematics of Circuits drawn in QUCS-S.
This is done to maintain a history of all iterations done to achieve
correct performance of circuits.

# Why start at Version 2.00?
Initial Iterations were done with simple tarball archives as backups.
But, they proved to be inefficient. So, employed GIT to maintain
version control at the latest and working iteration, with it being
the second iteration.

I felt lazy to create Git Repo with all the initial iterations, so,
started with version 2.00

Previous iterations are no longer needed, and hence considered to be
deprecated.

# Why MOS Model file is not included in this repo?
Simple, I use proprietary 65nm CMOS process' foundary models.
They cannot be shared due to NDA.
